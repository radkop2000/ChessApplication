Description:
This integration test focuses on testing the integration and functionality of a chess application, specifically
the process starting from the game start until an attempt at castling. The purpose is to ensure that the chess pieces,
board state, and related rules are correctly implemented and integrated to support the castling move.

Test Steps:

    Initialize the chess application and start a new game.
    Verify that the chessboard is set up correctly with the correct arrangement of pieces in their initial positions.
    Make the initial move for the white player, such as moving a pawn or a knight.
    Validate that the move is valid according to the rules of chess.
    Continue making moves for both players, to get to a point where the castling move is available.
    Perform the castling move.
    Validate that the castling move is executed correctly by updating the board state and moving the king and rook to their new positions.

Expected Results:

    The chessboard is set up correctly with the pieces in their initial positions.
    Moves made by players are valid and follow the rules of chess.
    The board state is updated accurately after each move.
    The castling move is only available under the appropriate conditions.
    Castling is executed correctly, resulting in the king and rook swapping positions.

Scenario: King has already moved.
    Steps:
        Perform moves to bring the game to a position suitable for castling.
        Move the king to a different position before attempting castling.
    Expected Result:
        The castling move should fail since the king has already moved.

Scenario: Rook has already moved.
    Steps:
        Perform moves to bring the game to a position suitable for castling.
        Move the rook to a different position before attempting castling.
    Expected Result:
        The castling move should fail since the rook has already moved.

Scenario: Pieces between the king and rook.
    Steps:
        Perform moves to bring the game to a position suitable for castling.
        Introduce one or more pieces (other than the king and rook) between them.
    Expected Result:
        The castling move should fail since there are pieces obstructing the path between the king and rook.

Scenario: King is in check.
    Steps:
        Perform moves to bring the game to a position suitable for castling.
        Place the king in a position where it is under threat (check).
    Expected Result:
        The castling move should fail since the king is in check.

Scenario: King moves through attacked squares.
    Steps:
        Perform moves to bring the game to a position suitable for castling.
        Create a situation where the squares that the king will move through during castling are under attack by opponent's pieces.
    Expected Result:
        The castling move should fail since the king would move through attacked squares, which is not allowed.

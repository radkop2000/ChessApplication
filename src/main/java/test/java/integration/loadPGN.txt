Loading and Replay of Chess Game from a PGN File

Objective: The objective of this integration test is to ensure that the chess application correctly loads a PGN
(Portable Game Notation) file and successfully replays the chess game from that file.


Test Steps:
    Launch the chess application.
    Select the option to load a PGN file.
4. Choose the specific PGN file for testing.
5. Verify that the PGN file is successfully loaded without any errors or exceptions.
6. Check if the chess game details (e.g., players' names, event information) from the PGN file are displayed correctly in the application.
7. Verify that the initial position of the chessboard matches the starting position of the loaded game.
8. Check if the application provides controls or buttons to navigate through the moves of the chess game.
9. Replay the moves of the chess game, one move at a time, using the provided controls.
10. Verify that the chessboard updates correctly after each move replayed.
11. Ensure that the move history is updated and reflects the moves being replayed.
12. Verify that the current position of the chessboard matches the position after each move is replayed.
13. Validate that the move highlights or indicators are displayed correctly on the chessboard, indicating the move being replayed.
14. Check if the application provides options to pause, resume, and stop the game replay.
15. Test the pause and resume functionality by pausing the game replay, waiting for a few seconds, and then resuming it.
16. Verify that the game replay continues from the paused position and progresses correctly.
17. Test the stop functionality by stopping the game replay.
18. Ensure that the chessboard returns to the initial position after stopping the game replay.
19. Check if the application allows skipping or jumping to a specific move in the game.
20. Select a specific move to jump to and verify that the chessboard and move history are updated accordingly.
21. Validate the end of the game conditions, such as checkmate, stalemate, or draw, based on the loaded game.
22. Verify that the application displays the correct result or outcome of the game.
23. Test the navigation to the next and previous games if the PGN file contains multiple games.
24. Verify that the application allows switching between different games in the PGN file and replays them correctly.
25. Close the chess application.

Expected Results:
1. The chess application launches successfully.
2. The option to load a PGN file is easily accessible.
3. The PGN file is loaded without any errors or exceptions.
4. The chess game details from the PGN file are displayed correctly.
5. The initial position of the chessboard matches the starting position of the loaded game.
6. The application provides controls or buttons for navigating through the moves.
7. The chess game replays correctly, updating the chessboard and move history accordingly.
8. The move highlights or indicators are displayed accurately during the game replay.
9. The pause, resume, and stop functionalities work as expected.
10. Skipping or jumping to a specific move updates the chessboard and move history correctly.
11. The end of the game conditions is identified and displayed accurately.
12. Navigation between multiple games in the PGN file is possible, and each game replays correctly.
13. The chess application closes gracefully without any errors.

Certainly! Here are some additional scenarios where the PGN file may contain mistakes:

Scenario 1: Invalid Move Syntax
- Create a PGN file with a move that has an invalid syntax, such as "Ke2" instead of "Ke2".
- Load the PGN file and verify that the application detects the invalid move syntax and displays an appropriate error message.
- Ensure that the application allows skipping the invalid move and continues to replay the remaining valid moves.

Scenario 2: Missing Move Number
- Create a PGN file where a move is missing its move number, such as "e4" instead of "1. e4".
- Load the PGN file and verify that the application handles the missing move number gracefully.
- Ensure that the application assigns the correct move number to the move based on the current position and continues to replay the game correctly.

Scenario 3: Invalid Move Order
- Create a PGN file with moves that are in an incorrect order, such as "1. e4 e5 1. Nf3".
- Load the PGN file and verify that the application detects the invalid move order and displays an appropriate error message.
- Ensure that the application either skips the invalid move or reorders the moves correctly to replay the game accurately.

Scenario 4: Invalid Move Notation
- Create a PGN file with a move that uses an invalid notation, such as "P@b5" instead of "b5" or "Nge8" instead of "Ne8".
- Load the PGN file and verify that the application identifies the invalid move notation and provides an error message.
- Ensure that the application handles the invalid move notation and continues replaying the game correctly after skipping the invalid move.

Scenario 5: Incomplete Game Tags
- Create a PGN file with incomplete or missing game tags, such as missing the "Event" or "Date" tags.
- Load the PGN file and verify that the application handles the incomplete game tags gracefully.
- Ensure that the application either displays default values or handles missing tags appropriately without causing any errors during the game replay.

These scenarios help ensure that the chess application can handle various mistakes or inconsistencies that may occur in the PGN file and still provide a smooth and accurate replay of the chess game.
